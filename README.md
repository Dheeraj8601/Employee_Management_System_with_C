## Technology Used:

- **Language:** C

The Employee Management System is a console-based application that allows users to perform various operations related to employee records. The implemented functionalities include:

- Inserting new employee records.
- Searching for employee records by ID.
- Editing existing employee records.
- Deleting employee records.
- Displaying all employee records.
- Generating salary slips.

## How to Run:

1. Open the project in Code::Blocks.
2. Compile and run the code.
